      <p>We evolve in every sphere of our lives. After school, we go for higher education and then graduate with professional qualifications. In our field of work, we begin as amateurs and then with experience we become experts in our work. In sports and other areas also, our expertise grows with practice and experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Then why donâ€™t we evolve spiritually with passing years?</strong></p>

      <p>We learn some basic rituals from our elders and continue to do the same for decades without evaluating their effects in our lives. This is unfortunate since spirituality is the most important aspect of our life which we ignore. Spirituality can bring more happiness and prosperity in our life than all our mundane worldly achievements put together.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 text-success">Stages of Enlightenment</h3>
      <p>The purpose of human birth is to attain our yoga (union) with God and become instruments to take care of His beautiful creation. Yoga is also called Enlightenment, Liberation and Salvation. We evolve through the following stages during our spiritual journey to eventually attain Enlightenment:</p>

      <ol class="lh-lg">
        <li>We do the SKB spiritual processes, which are our yagya (purifications) karma (actions) with discipline, happiness and surrender.</li>
        <li>Devotion (bhakti) and Divine Knowledge (gyan) awaken within us.</li>
        <li>We realize the supreme divine power, Shivashakti.</li>
        <li>We begin to feel the presence of the Almighty God within us.</li>
        <li>The wisdom awakens within us to see the One Supreme God in the multitude of divine forms.</li>
        <li>The energies of our subtle body purify and come in balance.</li>
        <li>Our Maa Kundalini awakens by the grace of Mahadeva Shiva and Aadishakti Maa Kali.</li>
        <li>After awakening, Maa Kundalini takes the form of fire and rises upwards through our spine. She pierces our chakras, purifies our subtle body and energizes it. She also awakens our Guru principle and increases our Aura.</li>
        <li>Innumerable godly attributes including the all-encompassing divine love awaken within us and we begin to manifest them in our thoughts, behavior and actions.</li>
        <li>When Maa Kundalini pierces our Sahasrara, she grants us our union with the all-pervading divine consciousness.</li>
        <li>The establishment of our union with the God is Enlightenment, Liberation, Salvation, Nirvana, Atmabodh, Mukti, Moksha and Spiritual Empowerment.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="mt-4">Our spiritual journey will be very enjoyable and blissful if we do not take the attainment of the ultimate destination very seriously. We must be careful of the trap of our ego in our spiritual journey. By the grace of Mahadeva Shiva and Aadishakti Maa Kali, we will surely attain our ultimate purpose of life.</p>

      <p>Along the way as we evolve spiritually, we will attain good health, happiness, joy, bliss, peace and all the good things of life. In SKB, a whole new way to live and enjoy life will open. There is nothing more beautiful, accomplished and fulfilling than Enlightenment. It is the biggest of all accomplishments and only the blessed ones attain it. Those who may not attain this state will nevertheless live a blissful happy and protected life.</p>
