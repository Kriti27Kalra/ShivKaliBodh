      <p>After 25 years of devoted worship, Guru Mahesh attained Enlightenment on 10th April 2017 and he was blessed with Shaktipath – the way to awaken the Mother Kundalini of devotees. He is also blessed with the process to purify our energies. He works tirelessly to spiritually empower mankind.</p>

      <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">Spiritual Journey</h3>
      <p>The destiny of Bhaiguru Mahesh propelled him on the path of enlightenment and union with the divine. His spiritual journey of 27 years is very interesting and inspiring.</p>
      
      <p>From his childhood he firmly believed in God. His parents taught him to respect all religions and inculcate the principles of humanity. During his early years, he had many experiences of the presence of the divine energy within. However, at that time he did not understand the meaning of these experiences.</p>

      <p>After completing his engineering, he tried to lead his life with the normal aspirations of a young man, but he soon realized that amassing wealth and material things just did not motivate him. The opportunist nature of people disturbed him emotionally. The desire of rich people towards money and power surprised him.</p>

      <p>He found solace in reading spiritual books, but this was not enough. The pain of seeking in his heart had become unbearable. He wished to do something to transform lives, but knew that he had to unite with the divine first.</p>

      <p>By 28, his seeking intensified. But he did not want to become a hermit. Inspired by Guru Nanak, he believed spiritual liberation was possible within family life. At 29, his Kundalini awakened by the grace of Mataji Nirmala Devi. He immersed himself in Sahaja Yoga, spreading Mataji’s message in North India with Anurag Kar.</p>

      <p>Eventually, he left Sahaja Yoga and in 2002, took initiation from Shri Babaji. He continued his spiritual journey till 2017, while balancing professional life. Many began calling him lovingly ‘Bhaiguru’. He became a devotee of Maa Kali and received divine truth, yet still felt incomplete.</p>

      <p>By March 2017, he left his second guru, meditated deeply, and prayed to Maa Kali. In April 2017, he was blessed with <strong>ShivKaliBodh</strong> – the supreme spiritual path for awakening Kundalini, divine union, and transformation. Since then, he has been working tirelessly to awaken divinity in mankind.</p>
